I spent almost the entire month of November 2016 in Morocco. I travelled both with a group of friends and also solo during the four weeks I was there.I stayed in six main destinations : Marrakech, Taghazout, Agadir , Chefchaouen , Fez and Tangier.  I flew into Marrakech and out of Tangier but apart from that all other internal transport was by taxi, bus or train. Having travelled so extensively to different parts of the country , I thought I'd share some advice and wisdom about travelling around Morocco.

<h3 class='post-sub-heading'>Private Taxi</h3>
Having flown into Marrakech with the intention of travelling to Taghazout , a destination around 280 km away with no direct bus , a group of three of us took a private taxi from central Marrakech to our pre-booked apartment in Taghazout. The journey took just short of four hours and cost 900 dirhams (€90) for the three of us. My advice here would be to pre-book . We didn't. We showed up at the taxi rank in Marrakech and got in the first taxi willing to take us to Taghazout. We wouldn't have saved any money ,  these kind of long distance fares are pre-determined and standard for most taxi drivers/companies. However pre-booking insures a reputable taxi company with a modern car and a driver who speaks english. The taxi we took had no seat belts (unfortunately quite standard in Moroccan taxi's) and was in bad condition. In fact we were quite surprised it arrived in Taghazout in one piece. Because the cost is set at a standard rate, the more people travelling , the cheaper the fare. Booking online also allow would also allow you to select a seven seater if you had a big enough group to keep the costs low. Also, they'd pick you up at the airport.

<h3 class='post-sub-heading'>SupraTours Bus</h3>

On our journey from Agadir to Marrakech we took the bus. The total journey time was around 2h40 and cost 110 dirhams per person. They also add an additional 5 dirhams per luggage item. There are two main bus operators who operate long journey routes in Morocco : Supra tours and CTM. They offer similar prices and levels of comfort and operate schedules at different times, so I'd advise to chose the bus based on the time that best suits your schedule. There are also many other smaller bus services that offer trips from outside the main bus terminals , which are best avoided. While they may offer cheaper ticket prices , it most likely includes a non-direct trip with many extra stops in a bus that may or may not have air conditioning, seats not guaranteed. When you arrive at the bus station there will most likely ticket touts for these unauthorised bus services hassling you to buy tickets from them outside the terminal. Be insistent with your refusal or tell them that you have already purchased your ticket, some of them can be extremely pushy. We took the supratours bus and overall our journey was extremely comfortable and well worth paying the couple extra dirhams to get the authorised bus service.

<h3 class='post-sub-heading'>Train</h3>
After a few days in Marrakech we set out on the journey to Fez. We had decided to take the train as it was a shorter journey time and was reasonably priced. There is no direct train from Marrakech to Fez, they all have multiple stops, going through Casablanca before heading on to Fez. Total journey time was just short of 8 hours. We purchased tickets at the train station before departing, opting for first class tickets. Our first class ticket was roughly 280 dirhams with the second class running at about 160. Bare in mind first class in Morocco is roughly equivalent or slightly below second class in most parts of Europe and second class here does not guarantee a seat. First class cabins come with air conditioning and seat six, while second-class seat eight. Considering the journey time was over seven hours we felt that the extra cost of a first class ticket was warranted.

<h3 class='post-sub-heading'>CTM Bus</h3>
My friends headed back to the states for thanksgiving and I made the decision to visit Chefchaouen , a beautiful town located in the mountains in the north of the country. Theres no train from Fez to Chefchaouen so I took the CTM bus from the Fez. The cost of the trip was 75 dirhams and the journey took 2h45. At this bus station they took my suitcase from me inside the bus terminal and I collected from under the bus when I arrived in Chefchaouen. I did deliberately check the luggage compartment when boarding the bus that my bag was there as I'd read online that sometimes luggage can get lost but there were no problems and the bag had safely made it aboard. Again the bus journey was comfortable and straight forward. Supratours don't offer a service from Fez to Chefchaouen so check the CTM timetable for departure times beforehand as they are not that regular.

<h3 class='post-sub-heading'>Grand Taxi</h3>
Eventually it was time to head to my final destination Tangier, from where I was flying back to Europe. I elected to take a grand taxi (a taxi between cities within Morocco). Again the more people that split the taxi fare the cheaper the cost of the journey. The way it works in Chefchaouen is you turn up at the taxi rank and tell them where you're heading. If you're willing to pay the entire fare yourself they will leave . Alternatively you can wait till more people to turn up to split the fare with. There were already three people waiting to go to Tangier when I arrived at the rank, so we decided to split the fare between the four of us and head off. It worked out just over 100 dirhams per person (€10) . Again we could've gotten it down to 75 if we had waited around for a couple more people to show up.

<h3 class='post-sub-heading'>Local Taxi</h3>
Throughout my time in Morocco I travelled in a number of local taxi's while visiting different parts of the city. These are small local taxis that operate only within the city in which you are travelling. They are normally uniformly coloured and clearly visible as a city taxi. In Agadir they are bright orange, Marrakech a dull yellow. These taxis are cheap normally only 10 or 20 dirhams, made cheaper by the fact that the driver routinely takes more than one set of passengers. To be honest , when I heard of this custom before I went there,  I found it a bit bizarre, thinking it would be awkward and uncomfortable. But you get so used to it , it becomes strange that they don't just do this everyone. At home, I rarely get taxis unless going somewhere as a treat, sharing it with others is something I think is a great idea.

Overall I found travelling around the country to be one of the more enjoyable and straightforward experiences of my time in Morocco. We had some bad experiences with the men there but the taxi drivers were always polite and helpful. Travelling solo was also not a problem as a female and I wouldn't hesitate to advise others of that.
