Every year in early December , Lyon, a city in central France, holds a lights festival, La Fete Des Lumieres , to celebrate the Virgin Mary. The story goes that as a statue of the Virgin Mary was due to be installed on the Fouvier hill in Lyon in early December 1952, a storm broke out and the decision was taken to abandon the celebration ceremony celebrating the installation of the statue. However as dusk approached the residents of Lyon, on seeing the weather was improving, spontaneously decided to head out into the streets, lighting candles and torches.

I was there in 2013. It was one of the coldest Decembers in a long time, the mercury hitting -10 celsius on one of the nights of the festival. I was living in the city at the time while in university and as the festival approached the temperature began to fall. My friends from university and I had organised to spend the festival together and on Friday set out to meet some of their friends who were coming from out of town for the weekend of the festival.

My most vivid memory is of the cold. I was wearing about half of my meagre student wardrobe including, sports skins a hoodie and my bright blue ski jacket which attracted the attention of almost every single person we passed as we alighted the tram. In France the large majority of the population , especially in Winter , wear dark clothing, so my bright light blue ski jacket attracted some judgemental looks. I didn't care in the slightest. In my view, it was far too cold for sensible fashion choices.

After we had all met up, we had dinner in Vieux Lyon. Lyon is famous for its good and in all the time I lived there I never had a bad meal in one of it's famous bouchons. We had reserved a table but had to wait in line outside for over an hour anyway. The food was delicious , as always, and afterwards we roamed the streets for hours taking in all the light instillments.  There were parades and movie shorts, food stalls and a ferris wheel with a movie short projected onto it. We ate waffles made with the biggest jar of Nutella I have ever seen in the street as we watched the animations. My favourite installment was a cartoon short projected onto the buildings of Place des Terreaux in the center of Lyon based on the famous book Le Petit Prince who's author hails from Lyon.

I had never heard of the festival before moving to Lyon and I was completely overwhelmed by the number of people that attended over the three day festival. I had never in my life seen so many people in one place. Lyon has a small city centre as it's located at the joining of two rivers. The city had closed off all roads in and out of this area (called the Presqu'ile) for the festival and the entire area was jammed with people. The city had also opened the public transportation system , meaning it was free for everyone to use. As we headed home that night we squeezed into a majorly overcrowded tram. We sat stationary for almost ten minutes before security had to remove people as the tram was to heavy to move. When it finally did start moving it moved slowly , the tram screeching along the ground as it grinded against it's rails.
