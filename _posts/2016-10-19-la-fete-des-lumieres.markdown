Every year in early December , Lyon, a city in central France, holds a lights festival, La Fete Des Lumieres , to celebrate the Virgin Mary. The story goes that as a statue of the Virgin Mary was due to be installed on the Fouvier hill in Lyon in early December 1852, a storm broke out and the decision was taken to abandon the celebration ceremony celebrating the installation of the statue. However as dusk approached the residents of Lyon, on seeing the weather was improving, spontaneously decided to head out into the streets, lighting candles and torches. The lights festival is a way to celebrate and remember this event.

I was there in 2013. It was extremely cold,even for December, the mercury hitting -10 celsius on one of the nights of the festival. I was living in the city at the time while studying at university and as the festival approached the temperature began to fall. Along with a couple of my friends from univeristy I set out on the first Friday of the festival to meet some friends who were coming from out of town for the weekend of the festival.

My most vivid memory is of the cold. I was wearing about half of my meagre student wardrobe including sports skins , a hoodie and my bright blue ski jacket which attracted the attention of almost every single person we passed as we alighted the tram. In France the large majority of the population , especially in Winter , wear dark clothing, so my bright light blue ski jacket attracted some judgemental looks. I didn't care in the slightest. In my view, it was far too cold for sensible fashion choices.

After we had all met up, we had dinner in Vieux Lyon. Lyon is known for its good food and in all the time I lived there I never had a bad meal in one of it's famous bouchons. We had reserved a table but had to wait in line outside for over an hour anyway. The food was delicious , as always, worth the wait. Afterwards we roamed the streets for hours taking in all the light installments.  There were parades and movie shorts, food stalls and a ferris wheel with a movie short projected onto it. We ate waffles made with the biggest jar of Nutella I have ever seen in the street as we watched the animations. My favourite installment was a cartoon short projected onto the buildings of Place des Terreaux in the center of Lyon based on the famous book Le Petit Prince who's author hails from Lyon.

Before moving to Lyon, the festival was completely unbeknownst to me and I was completely overwhelmed by the number of people that attended over the three day's it took place. I had never in my life seen so many people in one relatively small space.  Lyon has a small city centre as it's located at the joining of two rivers. The city had closed off all roads in and out of this area (called the Presqu'ile) for the festival and the entire area was jammed with people. It resembled a sports stadium immediately after a major event. 

The city had also opened the public transportation system for parts of the event , meaning it was free for everyone to use. (Which was great but created it's own problems.) As we headed home that night we squeezed into a majorly overcrowded tram. We sat stationary for almost ten minutes before security had to forcibly remove people. The tram was to heavy to move. When it finally did start moving it moved slowly , screeching along the ground as it grinded against it's rails.

We spent the rest of the weekend visiting the many attractions and installments dotted around the city. We didn't get them all but we were close. We visited the christmas market and ate too much. We visited Croix-Rouge and ate too much. The weekend ended and our friends left, the lights were taken down. Normality beckoned as my returned to lessons on Monday.

I tell all of my english speaking friends that the festival is a must-see but they rarely listen as they've never heard of it. It remains one of my best memories of my time in France as well as the first and only time I have ever had to queue for a metro station.
