A small sea-side town south of Valencia. Three hours by bus. October. Off season.

A restaurant with no sign. A crowd outside. No tables.

No menus. A chalkboard with a tapas list , passed from table to table.

An owner, with broken english and his chef , who also serves the wine.

Slow service and plentiful wine , hours pass.

Tuna, chicken , beef tartar , patats bravas : the classics.

â‚¬14 . Every time .

The best tapas in the world .

La Cajita.
