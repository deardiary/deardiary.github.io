I had intended to spend the day working, to chill out and not to anything to exciting or taxing. But a group of people were going paddle-boarding. They asked me to come and I couldn't resist. We drove to a small surf shop beside the nearest touristy beach and rented some paddle-boards managing to commandeer an instructor who agreed to go out on the water with us. The water was warm so we didn't need wetsuits , although some people opted to wear a rash vest.

After a short safety demonstration we set off. It was windy but thankfully there was little waves. It was tough. Much tougher physically than I had imagined, much tougher than kayaking or canoeing that I had done before. I loved it but I was terrible at it, definitely the worst one there. I have terrible balance and it took me a good while before I could stand up without falling over.

We spent about an hour in the water , reluctantly being summoned from the water by the instructor. Afterwards we struggled to carry the paddle-boards back to the surf shack as the wind had picked up and exhaustion had set in. We paid in the shop, â‚¬25 which I felt was a little expensive but not exorbitant for this part of Spain.

We drove back to the house and shortly afterwards we out in search of some food. We ate in a small restaurant in the corner of an empty food market that smelled of raw fish and had meat carcasses hanging on the walls. They didn't speak any English and we didn't speak any Spanish but boy was the food delicious. We drank too much and ate too much and we were the last ones to leave the restaurant before they closed for siesta.

In the afternoon I tried to get some work done but I was sleepy and unfocused and generally unproductive. Despite this I'm glad I went. In fifty years when I'm old and grey and can barely walk let alone paddle-board I might look back fondly on today, a day of fun , with good food and great people ( if i can remember anything at all ) . I'm unlikely to recall a productive work Thursday, many moons from now.
