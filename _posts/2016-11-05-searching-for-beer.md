I have an american friend. She’s here with me in Morocco. The 2016 American presidential election is next Tuesday. Given the events that have preceded Tuesday night we both felt alcohol would make the night's viewing more enjoyable. But Morocco is a Muslim country and Taghazout doesn’t sell alcohol. So we set out to find some.

We walked to the taxi rank and asked to be taken to Aghadir , the nearest town. Ten taxis , only us for passengers. Quiet night. We rode the twenty minutes to Aghadir
 chatting occasionally , the taxi driver on his phone - whatsapp he tell’s us. Apparently Morocco is all for new tech these days.

Without asking he told us that it was too late for alcohol at the market -  we’d have to go to another. Apparently we were not the first to make this trip. He took us there but it was also closed. And to another smaller establishment who’s owner told us that he could not sell us anything.  But he was less reluctant when we offered an extra 50 dirhams. We left with our overpriced beer and went home.

I must admit - There hasn’t been many nights where I have felt more of an alcoholic. Hopefully we won’t need it on Tuesday.
